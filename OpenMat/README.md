# OpenMat

This is the folder for our research project codes about **AI for material science**. We focus on applying deep learning models to crystal material property prediction and generation tasks. We have included the codes of our Matformer published at [NeurIPS 2022 conference](https://openreview.net/forum?id=pqCT3L-BU9T). We will add more codes in the future. Stay tuned!
